# Stilista
An iOS application to search for hair stylists and to search for clients.

### Why did I build an already existing app? 

Stilista compares your location with nearby users to create a list of hair stylists that are filtered by the distance you choose. 
Stilista also shows the exact location of the stylist that you wish to meet and allows you request an appointment. 
A user can sign up as a client or a hair stylist. After an appointment clients can also leave reviews on hair stylists. *Note Map-Kit does not work at all in the iPhone simulator.
